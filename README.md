# FinalProject
APCS Fall Semester Final Project 
Project Description:
To create a game modeling a prison escape/breakout. Takes elements of PacMan (into the enemy movement and chase), as well as Silent Hill (the flashlight/visibility) and more.
Specifics:

Directions:
Click on FinalProject.pde, and then run. Use your mouse and click on either the Campaign or Level Editor.
Use arrow keys to move the player and consequently, your flashlight in the Campaign. Picking up items and unlocking prisoners is automatic as you go over said prisoner/item.
For the Level Editor, click and pick the object. Once you have picked said object, pick the position to place the object. For walls, the first click establishes the top left corner, and use the "A" key to establish the second wall as whatever your mouse is on. 

Changelog:

Goals:
Attempt to save levels.
